# website in C
or to be more accurate, this is an HTTP server in C. It is one of my learning projects, and I thought to make it like a small website to showcase my passion for the C language and the tech world.

## Current state
as for now I am implementing the server as a non blocking, using the epoll API and non blocking sockets
I am currently debugging the non blocking sysytem, i need to better implement the han;ding of SIGNALS like SIGPIPE,
to avoid the server to STALL.

## Thanks for checking out my Resume!
yes! THANKS!
The idea behind this small project is to show what I am working on right now and to demonstrate my learning experience.
So this is my resume, you can reach out to me at lorenzopiombini3@gmail.com
