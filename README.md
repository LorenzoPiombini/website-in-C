# website in C
or to be more accurate, this is an HTTP server in C. It is one of my learning projects, and I thought to make it like a small website to showcase my passion for the C language and the tech world.

## Current state
created a non-Blocking TLS server and streamlined a little the request and response process.
it does seem to work better now.
there is still so much to improve:

- **handle SIGPIPE properly
- **implement a real HTTP/1.1 server
- **implement other methods than GET

## Thanks for checking out my Resume!
yes! THANKS!
The idea behind this small project is to show what I am working on right now and to demonstrate my learning experience.
So this is my resume, you can reach out to me at lorenzopiombini3@gmail.com
