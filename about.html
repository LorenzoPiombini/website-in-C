    <p class="c-margin font-style">My journey into programming started back in the early 2000s when I was in high school in Italy. I was playing around with the first versions of HTML, Visual Basic, a bit of PHP, and SQL. It was just a subject for me at the time.
    I remember that with some classmate we try to dive in C and assembly to develop Viruses and other stuff, However it felt really difficult, and playing Diablo II was easier ;)!
    Then, Life took me in a completely different direction, and I ended up in the restaurant business.<br>
Fast forward to 2020, during the pandemic, I found myself diving back into programming. I started with Swift and some web development, but honestly, I’ve never been a fan of web stuff. What really lit a fire in me was C. For some reason, I’ve always loved it—there’s just something about its simplicity and raw power.
So, I decided to go all in. I started learning C properly and got completely hooked. It’s the kind of language that makes me excited to wake up at 6 a.m. just to write code. That’s why I built this website. Instead of taking the easy route with a framework or CMS, I built a custom web server in C. Why? Because it felt right, and I wanted to prove to myself that I could.
This website is more than just a showcase; it’s my way of saying, "I love this stuff, and I’m following that instinct.</p>
